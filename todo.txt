Regarding glfw init - I want to end up seperating that from window creation
                    - currently I just want to get stuff appearing 

-- to add, look at returning raw ptr from create-factory function (dangerous)
-- let user know its raw ptr, properly take over ownership to destroy
-- probably make unique ptr
-- as long as user doesnt missue unique ptr, window destruction garunteed
-- transfer stuff to initliazlier list ( its easy but im tired )


currently working on window:

-- got logic for callbacks using glfw
-- able to make callbacks for window resizing
-- utilized
